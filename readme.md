### Project workflow using R

You may have heard about reproducibility in research and that using R is a good way to do it. But you are not a programmer and you don't even know where to start? This workshop is just what you need. If you are already familiar with R, join in and share your way of working in R with everyone. This workshop is an opportunity for us to learn tips and tricks from each other.  

In this workshop Betka will show you how she created her workflow and will give you some useful tips on how to structure your project and data and point you to resources on good practices that will guide you towards better reproducibility of your experiments. Things mainly talked about will include Rprojects from RStudio, Rmarkdown, googlesheets and tidyverse packages, project file management, and more.
