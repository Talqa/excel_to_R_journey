## Methods
  
  Here you write everything that was done and how it was done on the project.  
  
### Preparation of solutions
  
  All solutions were prepared based on this methodology/protocol.
  
  You can have as many paragraphs as you want.  
  
  To add calculations, you can use scientific notation:  
  
  This is alpha $\alpha$. 
  
  \[ \alpha + \beta = \gamma \]
    
  
### Random assignment  
  Groups were randomly selected based on weight of parts to allow for equal weight distribution between groups.   
  
  
### Recording callibrations  
  Parts were weight weekly. Each part was placed on scale (brand name, manufacturer name) and its weight was recorded. After returning the part into the board, it was callibrated using software (manufacturer name).
